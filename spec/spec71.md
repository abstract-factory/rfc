# Application integration

Digital asset management systems are not digitalc content creation suites; meaning no content is created using a DAM system.

A DAM system merely orchestrates externally running applications - each capable of running without the need for each other.

This is referred to as Application Integration and differs from Application Distribution in that each distributed application may operate independently from each other.

pipi is a lightweight, de-centralised and message-based digital asset management system; built for scalability, transparency and configurability, with minimalism and users in mind, for Lean Content Creation.
