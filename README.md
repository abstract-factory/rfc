This is the Abstract Factory RFC project.

The Abstract Factory RFC project is about collecting specifications for frameworks, methodologies and processes within the Visual Effects industry; each term further defined [here][]

To create a new RFC or propose changes to a draft, please fork the [RFC repository][].

Formal language described [here][formal language]

## Goal
To write down that which is unsaid and assumed and to do so in a consensus-oriented manner, as per [COSS][].

Many of the frameworks, methods and processes in Visual Effects, but also other content-centric industries, could be thought of as "unspoken standards". "standard" in that they are repeated from facility to facility and "unspoken" in that they do so without regard to its origin or history.

To quote from a book from an industry parallel to ours;

> Architects look at thousands of buildings during their training, and study critiques of those buildings written by masters. In contrast, most software developers only ever get to know a handful of large programs well—usually programs they wrote themselves—and never study the great programs of history. As a result, they repeat one another's mistakes rather than building on one another's successes. - [http://aosabook.org/en/index.html][]
