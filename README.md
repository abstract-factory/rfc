This is the Abstract Factory RFC project.

Vastly inspired by the [ZeroMQ RFC Project][], we collect specifications for APIs, file formats, wire protocols, and processes.

The change process is C4.1: http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:22 with a few modifications:

A specification is created and modified by pull requests according to C4.1.
Each specification has an editor who publishes the RFC to http://rfc.zeromq.org as needed.
Each specification has a status on that website: Raw, Draft, Stable, Legacy, Retired, Deleted.
Non-cosmetic changes are allowed only on Raw and Draft specifications.
